Hi! Welcome to my Pyhton projects!
Now I've completed 3.
.
The first one is the '180IQ Game'. You'll have to do math operations (plus, minus, multiply, subtract, square root, and factory) using the numbers on the LEFT-HAND SIDE in order to get the result that's EQUAL
OR CLOSEST TO the number on the RIGHT-HANDSIDE.
Also, the numbers on the LEFT-HAND SIDE used must be 1-DIGIT. For example, you've got 1234, you must take them as you've got 1, 2, 3, and 4, not 12, and 34, or 1, and 234, or the other round.
There are an easy mode, and a hard mode. The easy mode you'll get 4 numbers to operate them to the 2-digit result. The hard one you'll get 5 numbers, and have to make them 3-digit result.
Both mode will give you 60 seconds, so solve the problem before timing out!
.
The second one is the '20 Game'. This one is pretty easy to play! You'll have to play with another person. The game will start at '0', and the 'Player A' will be the person playing in the first round by 
default. In each round, you can add up to 3, and the number on the screen will be updated every round being played. 
Who reaches 20 first will LOSE. So, choose the number to add up stategically!
.
The last game is called 'Vote Out Game'. This game requires AT LEAST 5 PLAYERS. To start, type how many players in total and submit. Then, each player can only VOTE 1 PLAYER OUT for each round.
The player(s) who got voted out will be out of the game. For the next round, the player(s) who got voted out won't be able to vote someone else, and also won't be able to get voted out.
The last round will consist of 3 play. There will be 2 scenarios, either there will be 2 winners, or there will be no winners!
